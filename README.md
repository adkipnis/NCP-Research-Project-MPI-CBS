Code from a short research project at the Neural Interactions and Dynamics research group (https://www.cbs.mpg.de/departments/neurology/neural-interactions-and-dynamics) using MVPA with somatosensory EEG data.

MATLAB scripts are mostly built on top of the BBCI Toolbox (https://github.com/bbci/bbci_public).
